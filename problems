# 1. Two Sum

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

## Examples
**Example 1:**  
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]

**Example 2:**  
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]

## Approach
I used a hash map to store numbers and their indices as I iterate through the array.
For each number, I calculate its complement (target - current number) and check if that complement exists in the hash map.
If it does, I return the current index and the complement's index from the hash map.

## Solution Code
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []
